  caveats <<~EOS
    Sajilo Patro is not signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized yet.
    macOS will block the first launch. To allow it, open
      System Settings → Privacy & Security
    and click "Open Anyway" next to the Sajilo Patro message, then confirm.
    Only do this if you installed it from the official tap.
